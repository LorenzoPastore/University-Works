# Geographic Information Systems
The aim of this repository is to explore the potential of Data Science techniques.

The project is developed on Python 3 and uses the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- cartopy
- gzip 
- matplotlib
- wordcloud
- GDP
- king
- nltk
- scipy
- sklearn
- time
- urllib

For a correct execution of the project it is recommended to run the notebook (project.ipynb) on Google Colab, so you don't have to install any library.


For any doubt and/or perplexity, do not hesitate to contact us:
