## &#9741; &nbsp; Overview

Here you can find my solution to a project carried out to complete the examination of a class of the Master's Degree Course in Data Science that I am attending at University of Milano-Bicocca. <br>
The project consists in the resolution of a certain number of exercises that vary according to the number of the workteam, having two datasets available (that can be found in the "Datasets" section). <br>
In my case, I approached the project individually, so I only had to resolve the first 12 exercises. <br>
The various exercises require the correct use of Python, the famous programming language, with all the libraries we decided to use, among which we must mention *numpy* and *pandas*, saw during the lectures of the course. <br>
The main purpose of this project is to manipulate the aforementioned datasets and to extract from the data the most varied informations regarding the **Kiva dataset** and its applications.


<a name="instructions"></a>
## &#9741; &nbsp; Instructions

Starting from the *Kiva dataset*, all groups and individuals must do the following:



| References  | To do list                                                                     | Team size    | Status      |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Exercise 1  | _Normalize the loan_lenders table. In the normalized table, each row must have one loan_id and one lender._                                            | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 2  | _For each loan, add a column duration corresponding to the number of days between the disburse time and the planned expiration time. If any of those two dates is missing, also the duration must be missing._                                   | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 3  | _Find the lenders that have funded at least twice._                          | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 4  | _For each country, compute how many loans have involved that country as borrowers._ | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 5  | _For each country, compute the overall amount of money borrowed._                                                        | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 6  | _Like the previous point, but expressed as a percentage of the overall amount lent._                                | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 7  | _Like the three previous points, but split for each year (with respect to disburse time)._                                | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 8  | _For each lender, compute the overall amount of money lent. For each loan that has more than one lender, you must assume that all lenders contributed the same amount._      | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 9  | _For each country, compute the difference between the overall amount of money lent and the overall amount of money borrowed. Since the country of the lender is often unknown, you can assume that the true distribution among the countries is the same as the one computed from the rows where the country is known._                                                                 | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 10 | _Which country has the highest ratio between the difference computed at the previous point and the population?_                       | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 11 | _Which country has the highest ratio between the difference computed at point 9 and the population that is not below the poverty line?_         | 1            | &#10004;    |
| Exercise 12 |  _For each year, compute the total amount of loans. Each loan that has planned expiration time and disburse time in different years must have its amount distributed proportionally to the number of days in each year._             | 1           | &#10004;    |

### **Notes**

1. It is mandatory to use [GitHub](https://github.com) for developing the project;
2. The project must be a jupyter notebook;
3. There is no restriction on the libraries that can be used, nor on the Python version;
4. Post any question on the [Discussions](https://elearning.unimib.it/mod/forum/view.php?id=238437) forum.

## &#9741; &nbsp; Datasets

Here you can find the Kiva datasets used for the project available on the Kaggle platform. <br>


The snapshot provides information about 1.4M loans and 2.3M lenders.
Country level statistics and detailed economic grid data are provided as well.
